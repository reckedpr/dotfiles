# macOS Dotfiles

These are my macOS dotfiles, I wanted to put them in a repo so I could sync my 2 macs' configs; This repo is unlike other unix dotfile repo's, there are no setups or installers. 

I don't expect anyone to use these*, and that would probably be for the better.

*If you want to use them then clone and symlink to real locations.
